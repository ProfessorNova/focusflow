# Team roles

Our group consists of:

- Alexander Laukart
- Simon Raichle
- Pablo Rodriguez-Onorato
- Florian Wieland

We have decided to choose a group leader who will have a general overview of the project.
This position will be taken by Florian Wieland. </br>
The project will be split into four main work sections Frontend, Backend, Database and Testing. The assigned members are in charge of their section, but if there is downtime in development of a section, this section will support the others. Also the section aren't completely split so they are going to be mixed.

## Backend

Most of the work on the backend will be done by Alexander Laukart.

## Database

Simon Raichle will be mainly working on implementing the database.

## QA-Tester

The application is going to be mainly tested by Pablo Rodriguez and Florian Wieland.
