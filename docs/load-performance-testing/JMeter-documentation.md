# JMeter Documentation

For the Load and Performance Testing section we used Apache JMeter as the other tool Gatling was not suitable for our needs. Below is the documentation for JMeter, including setup, configuration, and results.

## Setup

- Literally as described in the documentation

## Load Profiles

- Read from result files


## Observations and Bottlenecks

SvelteKit is powerful and can handle a lot of requests.

First Spike Load Test with 100 User over 5 secounds - 2x repeated
=> No bottlenecks observed, all requests were successful and within acceptable response times.
